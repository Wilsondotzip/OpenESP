# OpenESP
A little place for creating open source ESP32 and ESP8266 IOT devices.

This is a mix of things like sensors and displays. I hope to grow the project library out so anyone can get started  with making their own ESP IOT device.

To keep things simple projects will most likely work on HomeAssistant through ESPHome. I plan on having either custom PCB layouts or plans for building your own proto boards available.

Things could change while the fine details are worked out... slowly
